// a)
// You are given a 2D grid representing a maze in a virtual game world. The grid is of size m x n and consists of 
// different types of cells:
// 'P' represents an empty path where you can move freely. 'W' represents a wall that you cannot pass through. 'S' 
// represents the starting point. Lowercase letters represent hidden keys. Uppercase letters represent locked doors.
// You start at the starting point 'S' and can move in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) to 
// adjacent cells. However, you cannot walk through walls ('W').
// As you explore the maze, you may come across hidden keys represented by lowercase letters. To unlock a door 
// represented by an uppercase letter, you need to collect the corresponding key first. Once you have a key, you can 
// pass through the corresponding locked door.
// For some 1 <= k <= 6, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first k letters of the English 
// alphabet in the maze. This means that there is exactly one key for each door, and one door for each key. The letters used to represent the keys and doors follow the English alphabet order.
// Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to collect all the keys and reach the exit point. 
// The exit point is represented by 'E'. If it is impossible to collect all the keys and reach the exit, return -1.
// Example:
// Input: grid = [ ['S','P','P','P'], ['W','P','P','E'], ['P','b','W','P'], ['P','P','P','P'] ]
// Input: grid = ['SPaPP','WWWPW','bPAPB']
// Output: 8
// The goal is to Collect all key
