// a)
// You are the manager of a clothing manufacturing factory with a production line of super sewing machines. The
//  production line consists of n super sewing machines placed in a line. Initially, each sewing machine has 
// a certain number of dresses or is empty.
// For each move, you can select any m (1 <= m <= n) consecutive sewing machines on the production line and 
// pass one dress from each selected sewing machine to its adjacent sewing machine simultaneously.
// Your goal is to equalize the number of dresses in all the sewing machines on the production line. 
// You need to determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this goal. If it is not possible 
// to equalize the number of dresses, return -1.
// Input: [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]
// Output: 5
// Example 1:
// Imagine you have a production line with the following number of dresses in each sewing machine: 
// [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]. The production line has 5 sewing machines.
// Here's how the process works:
// 1. Initial state: [2, 1, 3, 0, 2]
// 2. Move 1: Pass one dress from the second sewing machine to the first sewing machine, resulting in [2, 2, 2, 0, 2]
// 3. Move 2: Pass one dress from the second sewing machine to the first sewing machine, resulting in [3, 1, 2, 0, 2]
// 4. Move 3: Pass one dress from the third sewing machine to the second sewing machine, resulting in [3, 2, 1, 0, 2]
// 5. Move 4: Pass one dress from the third sewing machine to the second sewing machine, resulting in [3, 3, 0, 0, 2]
// 6. Move 5: Pass one dress from the fourth sewing machine to the third sewing machine, resulting in [3, 3, 1, 0, 1]
// After these 5 moves, the number of dresses in each sewing machine is equalized to 1. Therefore, the minimum number of 
// moves required to equalize the number of dresses is 5.
